    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pandan chiffon cake is very well-loved in Southeast Asia. In case you are wondering what a pandan is, it is a leaf. Also known as screwpine leaf. You can extract pandan juice to be used in cooking and baking. It is so flavorful that I seriously want to bottle up the flavor and turn it into a fragrance. Pandan chiffon cake is basically just chiffon cake infused with pandan flavor and its green color. I love chiffon cake for its soft, pillowy, and spongy texture.</p>
